He/They

<img style="width:100%" src="/samiir_saunders.jpg" />

Samiir Saunders is a mixed media poet based in Birmingham. Their work consists of experimental digital poetry, page poetry, spoken word performance, and video-poetry. Samiir’s poems and artworks examine the tension between a desire to communicate authentically and the limitations of digital technology (and indeed, of language itself). He explores how the internet’s seemingly unlimited pool of information sits within a wider context of capitalism, post-colonialism, and the various erasures therein, whilst also finding a space for playfulness and the acceptance of ambiguity.
