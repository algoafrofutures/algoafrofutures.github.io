#### (Algo|Afro) Futures is a mentoring programme for early career UK-based Black artists who want to explore creative coding and live coding.

#### Live coding is a performative practice where artists and musicians use code to create live music and live visuals. This is often done at electronic dance music events called Algoraves, but live coding is a technique rather than a genre, and has also been applied to noise music, choreography, live cinema, and many other time-based artforms.

Since its inception in 2014 there have been hundreds of Algoraves taking place in over 100 cities and festivals around the world, including performances at Glastonbury, Sonar, SXSW, Bluedot, Mutek and Transmediale. There have been many events in Birmingham including audio/visual focussed parties at Vivid projects in Digbeth.

## Programme overview
(Algo|Afro) Futures will take place between June - August at Vivid Projects in Birmingham.
The mentoring programme consists of five workshops focusing on live coding music and visuals. [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) will be the software used for creating music, and [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) the software used for creating visuals.

At the conclusion of the workshop each participant will demonstrate their newly-aqcuired skills in a performance of up to 15 minutes in front of a live audience. You can view documentation and recordings of previous editions by following the links below:

* [2022](/2022-programme/)
* [2021](/2021-programme/)

The programme will be delivered by mentors Antonio Roberts and Tyger Blue. Read more about them in the [About](/about#Mentors) page.

## Applicant profile
We are looking for applications from Black early career artists developing work within performing arts practices (music, choreography, live/performance art, etc). Prior experience in coding is not required - only a curiosity to learn! Live coding is surprisingly accessible, and as an algorithmic artform has more in common with weaving, cooking and knitting than software engineering. We are interested in supporting people in taking it in new directions.

## Key information

* The call is open from Thursday 10th April to Monday 5th May 23:59 BST

* Up to six applicants will be selected to take part

* Each participant is supported by an access bursary of up to Â£500

* This opportunity is open to UK-based Black artists only

* Exact workshop and performance dates are available on the [2025 Mentoring Programme](/mentoring-programme) page.

The deadline for applications is 5th May 2025 23:59 BST. Applications received after that date will not be considered. [Apply here](/apply).
