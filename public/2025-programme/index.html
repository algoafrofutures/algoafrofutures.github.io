<p>Bundy is a Leeds-based artist and biologist. For him, music is as much an avenue for exploration as it is for connection – demonstrated by his genre-blending, versatile work. A co-founder of the Brum-based collective STK, he has written music for TV and also produces for other musicians.</p>
<p>Since discovering live-coding while supporting the band Kelora, he has begun to fuse machine-coded generative beats with his guitar-led tracks. He aspires to elevate representation for black artists in electronic music through (Algo|Afro) Futures, with an eventual goal of creating a cypher-esque performance pairing MCs and instrumentals that evolve in real time.</p>

<p>Sheba Q is a London-based vocalist, turntablist, and mathematics teacher whose artistry bridges her East Afrikan heritage with UK bass music. Her musical journey is deeply rooted in her Bantu/ Nilotic lineage, with ancestral ties to the Queen of Sheba. Known predominantly as a Jungle and Drum &amp; Bass DJ, Sheba Q also crafts immersive soundscapes with her voice that resonate with cultural depth and melodic complexity. Her dual passion for music and mathematics reflects her belief in the interconnectedness of patterns and sequences, whether it be melodies or numbers. Through her participation in the (Algo|Afro) Futures mentorship programme, she aims to further enhance her sonic explorations learning live coding/ production to enrich her craft and ever growing community.</p>
